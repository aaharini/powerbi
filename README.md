This project contain the dummy data to analyse the call center performance. This data contains the one month data of 8 employees in the call center.

Chart 1 (line chart)

Objectives:
 
  To analyse the average handling time of agents per day.

Insights:

  Averate handling time fluctuates across different days, suggesting inconsistent call complexity or uneven workload distribution.

Action:

  Analyse high handle time days and allocate additional agents or provide call handling guidelines for the agents to manage complex 
  calls which increase the resolve call rate. 

Chart 2 (pie chart)

Objectives:

  To analyse the call status of answered, resolved and missed calls.

Insights:
  Resolved and answered calls form the largest and equal propotion, indicating the most customers issues are successfully handled and most calls are answered. 
  However the proportion of missed calls is still high, showing room for improvement in call handling capacity.

Action:
  Increasing in missed calls shows there is availabiliy of extra agents to handle the call service.

Chart 3 (Bar chart)

Objectives: 

To analyse the average handling time of each agents.

Insights:

Some employees handle the call for long time and others call handl time is low. This showe difference in call efficiency of agents.

Action:

The agents with low handling time need training and standardized call scripts can also help to improve efficiency.

Chart 4 (column chart)

Objective:

To analyse the customer satisfaction.

Insights:

The customer satisfaction score is vary across among agents, eventhough the some agent's
handling time is high their satisfaction score by customers are low.

Action:

Identify best performing agents and use their interaction approach as a benchmark for coaching other team members.

Visualization 5 (slicer)

The agents name in the slicer help the managers to analyse all the agents performance individually among various charts.
