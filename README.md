Project Overview

This project uses a dummy dataset to analyse call center performance for one month covering 8 employees.
The dashboard helps managers understand efficiency, service quality and customer experience.

Chart 1: Line Chart – Average Handle Time per Day

Objective:

To analyse the average handling time of agents per day.

Insight:

Average handle time fluctuates across different days, indicating inconsistent call complexity and uneven workload distribution.

Action:

Analyse high handle-time days and allocate additional agents or provide call-handling guidelines to manage complex calls and improve the resolved call rate.

Chart 2: Pie Chart – Call Status

Objective:

To analyse answered, resolved and missed calls.

Insight:

Answered and resolved calls form the largest and almost equal proportion, showing most customer issues are successfully handled.
However, the missed calls portion is still significant, indicating capacity gaps.

Action:

Increase agent availability during peak hours to reduce missed calls and improve customer reach.

Chart 3: Bar Chart – Average Handle Time by Agent

Objective:

To analyse the average handling time of each agent.

Insight:

Some agents take longer while others handle calls faster, showing differences in efficiency and experience.

Action:

Provide training and standardized call scripts to slower agents and use top performers as mentors.

Chart 4: Column Chart – Customer Satisfaction

Objective:

To analyse customer satisfaction scores.

Insight:

Customer satisfaction varies among agents.
Even some agents with high handle time have low satisfaction, showing that speed alone does not guarantee quality.

Action:

Identify best-performing agents and use their interaction style as a benchmark for coaching others.

Visualization 5: Slicer – Agent Name

Objective:

To enable managers to analyse individual agent performance across all charts.

Insight & Action:

Managers can quickly filter by agent to monitor performance, identify issues, and take targeted improvement actions.
